# twitter-online-analysis

This twitter analysis outputs an histogram of the twitter account you have specified.
The histogram consists of the most active time in the twitter based on recent 200 tweets.

The histogram has time(x-axis) vs no.of tweets.
This enables us to see the most active time spent by user based on analysing 200 tweets upload time.
for example : based on my last 200 tweets, the histogram shows the most active time of mine is 12-14. 
may be or may be not it is the real active time but.

***Note: the active time of the user currently shown is based on previous 200 tweets only , not based on the whole activity of the user

This is in development process.....
